Users created by admin will have special status set to 1

But main admin user will have level of 10 [for activation matching]

Users must complete their profile before accessing parts of the platform [middleware]

I'm sending scheduled tasks such as Deleting inactive users and blocking users for not payment under Jobs. App\Jobs. This is so the delay time can be sent for scheduled handling.

Admin Blocking will not require scheduling.


-- reminder

Mature dates and schedules shoud be reset to follow normal conventions

previous investment = 1.5 * balance

notifications on every activation

put timer in all the matchings

confirmation when making withdrawals
